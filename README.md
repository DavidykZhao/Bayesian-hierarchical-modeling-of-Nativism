# Bayesian-hierarchical-modeling-of-Nativism

This project utilizes a series of non-informative priors to make sure the objectivity of the results. For example, this project sets the prior sample size to 1 to reduce the influence of the prior. This paper also uses a big prior variance to greatly support the parameter space while not conveying much information. 

With the priors set then this paper uses Gibbâ€™s sampling to simulate 5000 iterations and approximate the posterior distribution of the both levels.
